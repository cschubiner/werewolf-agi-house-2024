everyone uh welcome to this more advanced tutorial on how to build agents
and how to specifically um use the versus Runner file um to test werewolf
agents um against other agents on your local machine we'll also have a chance
to um look at how do you look into the transcripts of different agents and just
cover some basic tips and tricks for uh using this code base while building
werewolf agents so to get started I'll just quickly spin up uh a new directory
for this um [Music]
[Music] okay so the the goal of this is um to
try to use this versus runner. piy file and to use this for maybe a new agent
that you've made that's separate from the template agents um so but in order
so as we can see here this versus runner. piy file Associates a name with
a role such as wolf with um an agent type um and you can see down here we
specify the configurations for those different agent types including where
it's getting that wheel file from so in order to run this we're going to start
out by um going through each of these different um
temp so you can see here it's using the different template agents there's the
coot autogen and simple um to get started I'm just going to build each of
these because I haven't built them uh in this fresh directory so I'm going to go
to um [Music]
and now if we look here you will see that I built each one of these fresh um
now the problem here is uh well normally when you're doing this you really should
run each of these agents and just the regular Runner to make sure they're
working and especially if during the the tournament you're submitting to a live
game make sure that you run this Runner first cuz um that could just lead to a
bunch of issues for us um as we're trying to run your game and project it
on screen uh so just keep that in mind but these are kind of the default
template agents as they are so I don't really need to change them one thing I
do need to change though is these um whe file paths um well except here actually
these wheel file paths um have been uh these are relative paths so this should
work um just to test this all out now I can
go back into a root directory and try running and then's see what happens okay
and I did not follow all the steps of the read
me I also did not include this um unv just going to pause this recording
here now that I added myv file back in here and now that I installed python.
EnV this is not this for this is just EnV for Mac or this is silicon um and
now I'm going to um try again okay and looks like um it's
getting started let's see what happens so now let's check what's
happening in the game we log into
hydrogen and here we are we can clearly see um kind of different agents playing
the game um here I I just run versus Runner as it is um nothing nothing fancy
now let's say you what if you want to run versus Runner with an agent of your
own design um easy way to see how we can do that is let's just take
our simple sample template make a copy of it I'll rename this
to I'm going to call this cool agent and cool agent is going to be a
really um simple adaptation of this super simple agent um I'm going to
say always try to be as cool as possible even if
it's a little obnoxious and I'm also going to just
just so that we can really see this agent in action and see if this is
working um I'm just going to go in here and I'm going to just say
plus cool so it's just going to end everything it says or even better we can
start it out with there um so now we do have this
game going just going to interrupt this well see how far we
are and one uh important tip uh do not hit control C to stop a game more than
once if you do you may have to go into Docker
um and clear out your um images and containers because otherwise you will um
when you interrupted even when I interrupted just there it's possible
that I need to do this um but hopefully this will still work we're going to go
um back to our versus Runner file and I'm just going to add a new config
so um we're going to call this cool make sure you add a comma here and
so for cool we're going to go into a cool
agent grab the path stick the path
here and because cool is just a duplicate of super simple the module
path and this is the path to the agent file within the wheel file and so
remember when you're creating a wheel file here if you look at this cool agent
directory there's this P project. Tomo file that dictates how this um wheel
file is created and it starts with um it's saying you should go into this
agent directory um and um you're we're building a p r.
Tomo file sorry we're building a wheel file for this agent um directory um and
so now if we go back to our versus Runner what we need here is
the within agent the place that we said you should build this wheel file where
is the agent file so here it's just a Super simple. PI because we made a copy
in Collision we didn't rename this this actually stays the same then for the
config path um this config is a bit of an outdated thing your agents have no
access to Internet and um can only access the llms uh
through kind of a way I described in a previous tutorial um and given that we
just need to provide any like blank config here so this is providing you
know the blank config in simple sample already we can leave that as it is and
the agent class name we also didn't change so we can leave that as this so
this should be all good to go we're just going to take one of these and we're
going to rename this cool guy and I would recommend not just to be
safe don't add spaces or um even don't don't add spaces and try
not to add uppercase letters to names U just can be useful um and now we're
going to call it this cool um and
now let's try running this again
okay and here we are we got the game running and um clearly the cool guy
agent is operating according to the modifications that we made here um yeah
okay now let's take it one step further even what if you want
to use versus Runner to run games that maybe other people run games with agents
that maybe other people in your group have made or Run games with agents that
um maybe people in even other groups have made um to test this out let's see
if I go here um I have
here I have a couple agents sent by a couple friends of mine um if I want to
use versus Runner to test out these agents all I have to do is go here make
a couple more of these and then fill them out
appropriately so Anton agent sent by Anton I can go left click on
this copy this path I'm going to call this just my
friend's name and I know um so you'll have to
check this but I know the module path hasn't been changed here I know we can
still use my blank config and I know that this hasn't been changed either now
this one we're going to call O and we're going to grab olg's
agent now with oleg's agent we actually know that the module path was changed
this is XR a agent and we know that the class name
was also actually changed to now I
can try running this all again I'm going to check to make sure that I and as
these are wheel files everything should already be built um make sure that we're
rebuilding images here and oh almost forgot to add these in here so let's say
we're going to give um Frodo let's rename Frodo as Anon we're going to give
him the role of and let's replace Bilbo here with a
leg okay so now we have Anton o these are some of the temped agents in there
and let's see what happens okay and while this game gets up
and running um let's take a look at the transcripts we see from these games as
they're created um if we look at the transcripts
so we can see here the last game that played um we can see the last so um if
you run this versus Runner file it'll print the game State at the end or log
the game St at the end and we can see that the last standing player in this
game was Mary do and Loa we can also see that the winners of this game were um
the villagers so meru and loo were villagers
and then it's pretty easy we can go into the um transcript for one of these
players so we can just go to mer do. log um or sorry Maria do all you have to do
is just click any way use this editor and here you now have the um transcript
for the entire game now this transcript has the logs if we want just the
transcript we can go here let's open it and here we go this is the transcript
from the entire game um because Maria do is a doctor we
basically are just seeing the s Maria do is a villager um and we can see that in
the first one um basically all of these messages will just be in the play Arena
so you can think of this as like a full play arena chat of course if I went in
and uh came in from the perspective of one of the werewolves so I look for cool
guy I'm go to the transcript for cool guy let open this up
and now we'll also see what's happening in the wolf group um because
because we know that cool gu is a wolf so that's pretty
cool and now we can see um all these different agents including cool guy
Anton and Oleg interacting
um seems like Anton made an agent that talks like a pirate um
cool guys just try to be cool and let's see what Oleg
did interesting and there we go um we have
uh three agents built by three different
people running on my computer
